\paragraph{Steinitz exchange lemma} Let $V$ be a vector space, and $L, S \subset V$ are finite such that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Elements of $L$ are linearly independent;
    \item The span of $S$ is $V$.
\end{enumerate}

Then, $|L| \leq |S|$ and there is a set $S' \subset S$ such that $|S'| = |S| - |L|$ and the span of $L \cup S'$ is $V$.    

\paragraph{Proof}

Consider the sequence $T=S_1,\dots,S_{|S|}$. We do the following for each of $L_1,\dots,L_{|L|}$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Append $L_i$ to the beginning of $T$;
    \item Remove the last vector of $T$ that is a linear combination of preceding vectors.
\end{enumerate}

Neither of the steps changes the span of $T$ (Lemma 1.23). Therefore, $L_i \in \operatorname{span} T$, and adding $L_i$ to $T$ creates a linear dependence in $T$. This ensures that $T$ has a dependent vector (Lemma 1.19), and it is not a vector of $L$, because they are only preceded by other vectors of $L$.

In the end, $T$ will consist of $L$ and $S' \subset S$ such that $|S'| = |S| - |L|$, and $\operatorname{span} L \cup S' = \operatorname{span} T = V$.
